ILIAD examples:
      2D mapping with laser scanner on cititruck
	/graph_map/launch/examples/2d_fuser_oru_example.launch - replace robot1 to deploy on different robots

      3D mapping with Velodyne-32E scanner on bt truck
      	 graph_map/launch/private/orkla/mapping_orkla_bt.launch

      3D mapping with velodyne-16 on cititruck
      	 graph_map/graph_map/launch/private/iliad/mapping_citi_velo16.launch

The launch files can be used for any robot in the iliad project, replace robot_id to match the desired robot.




After mapping is completed, save the ndt and occupancy map map using the commandd: /graph_node/save_map "{}", defeault output folder is /graph_map/maps/.
